Entropy
=======

A browser-based application that shows a gas expanding freely
when a partition is removed between the two sides of a box.

The idea for this app was shamelessly copied from
[this java applet](http://stp.clarku.edu/simulations/approachtoequilibrium/index.html).
I was motivated to write my own knock-off using HTML 5 because of hassles relating to
the current state of java applets.
